# Colaberry Design System

**Make the best UI the easiest UI for an agent to generate.**

A working design system that humans, developers, and AI coding agents can all read from — built
end-to-end for **Colaberry, the School of Data Science & Analytics**. Not a static style guide, but a
running, branded system where every token, color, and component in the docs is the same code that
ships to production.

## Quick start — pick your path

| You are… | Do this |
|---|---|
| **Marketing / non-technical** | Open this project in Claude (or invoke the `colaberry-design` skill) and ask in plain English — *"Using the Colaberry design system, make a square Instagram post for our Spring cohort…"* You get a downloadable, on-brand HTML artifact. No code. |
| **Developer** | Link `styles.css` (tokens + fonts) and `_ds_bundle.js` (components on `window.ColaberryDesignSystem_098454`). Reference **semantic tokens**, never raw hex. → [Using it in a project](#using-it-in-a-project) · [`IMPLEMENTATION.md`](IMPLEMENTATION.md) |
| **Designer** | Open `design-system.html` (the living guide) + `BRAND.md`; reuse logos, colors, and type from `assets/`. |
| **AI agent / Claude** | Start any prompt with *"Using the Colaberry design system, …"* — `SKILL.md` loads the rules so the output snaps to brand on the first try. |

There's **no build step** — `npm start` (alias for `npx serve .`) serves the whole thing at `http://localhost:3000`.

## What this is

This repo turns the Colaberry brand into an **executable UI language**.

A designer owns the source of truth (brand, logo, voice); a developer imports one stylesheet and a
component bundle; an AI agent reads the same files through a documented skill and generates UI that
snaps to the system on the first try. The docs site you see is built from the very tokens and
components it documents — change a token, every surface updates.

It walks the full pipeline end-to-end:

```
Brand style guide + logo  →  Claude  →  vector logo + token foundation
                                      →  20 React components + living docs
                                      →  GSAP / Three.js landing  →  static host
```

---

## How it was built (the AI-driven workflow)

Strategy, brand direction, and every design decision were **owned and directed by the designer**;
**Claude (Anthropic)** ran as the executing agent for each step.

| # | Step | What happened |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Source brand** | Colaberry School style guide + logo PNGs (cherry mark, wordmark) |
| 2 | **Rebuilt the mark** | Traced the raster logo into clean art + a full favicon / app-icon / OG export set |
| 3 | **Token foundation** | palette → neutral → semantic → typography → spacing → radius → motion → data-viz → breakpoints (245 tokens, light + dark) |
| 4 | **Real components** | 20 React primitives wired to those tokens, each with `.d.ts` types + usage prompt |
| 5 | **Applied the brand** | Cherry `#FB2832` · Leaf `#77BB4A` · Berry `#367895` · Roboto + Roboto Mono + Quicksand |
| 6 | **Living docs + landing** | Scroll-spy docs site, WCAG audit, and an awwwards-style GSAP + Three.js landing page |
| 7 | **Shipped** | MIT license, GitHub Pages workflow, hand-off + prompting guides |

## The three-layer architecture

**1 · Design layer (source of truth)**
`BRAND.md` + `assets/` (logo lockups, marks, favicons, OG cards, fonts). Where the designer edits;
token names map 1:1 to CSS variables.

**2 · Code layer (developer-consumable)**
- `styles.css` — single entry point; `@import`s the token + font layers.
- `tokens/colors.css` — Cherry / Leaf / Berry 10-step ramps + neutrals + semantic aliases + **data-viz palette** + dark theme.
- `tokens/typography.css` — Roboto / Roboto Mono / Quicksand ramps, weights, line-heights.
- `tokens/spacing.css` — 4px grid, radius, shadow, motion, **breakpoints + 12-col grid**.
- `tokens.json` — all 245 tokens (+ dark overrides) for Style Dictionary / Figma Tokens / Tailwind.
- `components/core/*` — 20 primitives (`.jsx` + `.d.ts` + usage prompt + live card), bundled to `_ds_bundle.js`.

**3 · Agent layer (LLM-consumable)**
`SKILL.md` + the living docs + `IMPLEMENTATION.md` + the built-in prompt templates. What an AI agent
reads to generate on-brand UI — start any request with *"Using the Colaberry design system, …"*.

---

## What's inside

- **245 design tokens** — light + dark, every value a semantic CSS variable; exported as `tokens.json` for tooling.
- **Data-visualization palette** — categorical (8) + sequential + diverging chart scales, color-blind safe, theme-aware.
- **Design principles**, responsive **breakpoints + 12-col grid**, and accessibility guidance beyond contrast (keyboard, focus, touch, semantics).
- **20 accessible components** — Accordion, Avatar, Badge, Breadcrumb, Button, Card, Carousel,
  Checkbox, Dialog, Drawer, Input, Pagination, Popover, Progress, Skeleton, Switch, Table, Textarea,
  Toast, Tooltip.
- **Full logo system** — color / mono-white / mono-black marks + lockups, app-icon tile, `favicon.ico`,
  apple-icon, 192/512 icons, square + OG / GitHub social cards.
- **A marketing-website UI kit** — Home · Program · Enroll, composed only from the components.
- **WCAG 2.2 contrast audit**, logo do/don't rules, and **hand-off + prompting guides** for marketing,
  designers, and developers.

### Routes

| Route | What you'll see |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Landing — animated hero, color, type, components, examples, get-started |
| `design-system.html` | The full living system (scroll-spy nav + light/dark toggle) |

## Using it in a project

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">      <!-- tokens + fonts -->
<script src="_ds_bundle.js"></script>           <!-- components on window.ColaberryDesignSystem_098454 -->
```

Reference **semantic tokens** (`var(--brand-accent)`, `var(--surface-page)`, `var(--text-strong)`),
never raw hex. Set `data-theme="dark"` on `<html>` for dark mode — the cherry accent stays constant.
Full steps (plain HTML, React/Vite/Next): [`IMPLEMENTATION.md`](IMPLEMENTATION.md).

## In production — a worked example

The system isn't only for marketing artifacts; it drives real product UI. A recent example: the
**course cards** in the Colaberry learning portal (the Anthropic / Skilljar "course wrapper").

The starting point was a generic card with **broken information architecture** — three source badges
stacked above the title, so metadata outranked the actual course, with card sizes that varied section
to section. Rebuilt entirely on this system, it became a **bento** layout: a featured "Start here"
course, compact supporting tiles, and a cherry path-summary anchor — assembled from `Card`, `Badge`,
and `Button` with semantic tokens only, Roboto + Roboto Mono numerals, `--radius-xl`, and dark-mode
support out of the box.

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Tokens | hardcoded hex | semantic tokens only |
| Information architecture | source badges above the title | content leads; source is a quiet kicker; grouped meta |
| Layout | inconsistent card sizes | intentional bento hierarchy + responsive fallbacks (3 / 2 / 1 course) |
| Accessibility | white-on-cherry 3.8:1 (fails AA) | text-bearing cherry moved `--red-500` → `--red-600` = 4.7:1 (AA) |
| Dark mode | flat token inversion | lifted surfaces + border/glow elevation |

**The method that drove it** — a repeatable, critique-led loop you can run on any page with this system:

> **anchor** to the tokens + components → fix **information architecture** before pixels → choose a
> **layout system** (uniform grid *or* bento — never ad-hoc) → **decide** → gate on **accessibility**
> (contrast ratios + a heuristic pass) → **polish** the edges (dark mode, empty / long / 1-vs-many
> states) → **approve** against the brand principles.

> **Systemic note from that audit:** white text on the brand cherry `--red-500` is only 3.8:1. Use
> `--red-600` / `--red-700` for text-bearing cherry surfaces; reserve `--red-500` for non-text accents.

## Brand foundations (at a glance)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Cherry Red** `#FB2832` | Primary action / the constant accent |
| **Leaf Green** `#77BB4A` | Growth / secondary |
| **Berry Blue** `#367895` | Trust / links / the wordmark |
| **Type** | Roboto (display + body) · Roboto Mono (data) · Quicksand (logotype only) |
| **Shape** | Rounded & friendly — pill buttons, 12–32px card radii, 4px grid |
| **Voice** | Warm, inclusive, emoji-free; speak to "you"; lead with proof |

Full brand rules, motion, and accessibility live in [`BRAND.md`](BRAND.md).

## Deploy

Push to GitHub and enable Pages — a workflow is included at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```bash
git init && git add . && git commit -m "Colaberry Design System v1.0"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-account>/colaberry-design-system.git
git push -u origin main
```

Then **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**. Works equally on Netlify, Vercel, or Cloudflare
Pages with no build step. Full guide: [`DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md).

## What's next — the 30-60-90 roadmap

**30 days · Foundation** ✅ *shipped in this repo*
- ✅ Token foundation (palette + neutral + semantic + type + space + motion), light + dark.
- ✅ Vector logo system + full favicon / app-icon / OG export set.
- ✅ 20 accessible components with `.d.ts` types and usage prompts.
- ✅ Living docs, WCAG 2.2 audit, awwwards-style landing, hand-off + prompting guides.

**60 days · Build**
- Add Storybook for component-by-component browsing.
- Extract `tokens/` + `components/` into a publishable `@colaberry/design-system` npm package.
- **LLM component manifest** — machine-readable JSON of every prop, state, and import path.
- Self-host fonts; add a second UI kit (the LMS / course dashboard).

**90 days · Integrate & govern**
- **MCP server** exposing the manifest so any Claude / agent session can pull the system in-IDE.
- Quality gates: token lint, axe for a11y, visual-regression, dependency scanning.
- Contribution workflow — RFC → PR → designer signoff → release.
- Pilot integration with a first Colaberry product app.

## Quality gates (five-gate model)

| Gate | Tool | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| Token lint | Style Dictionary / Tokens Studio | Hardcoded hex / spacing values |
| A11y | axe + Playwright | Contrast, focus, semantic labels |
| Visual regression | Chromatic / Percy | UI drift across components |
| Security | SAST + dependency scan | Unsafe inputs, vulnerable deps |
| Designer signoff | PR review | Pattern fit, UX intent |
